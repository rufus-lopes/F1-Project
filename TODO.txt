rolling average:

choose a good time/packet gap to get the average over

calculate averages and append them to new dataframe --> can probably just add another function to DB expander for this.

CSV writer would need some modification --> if calculation heavy then perhaps needs another thread to handle computation (averages and total)

otherwise average implementation seems relatively simply?
