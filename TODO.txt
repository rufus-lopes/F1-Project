rolling average:


CSV writer would need some modification --> if calculation heavy then perhaps needs another thread to handle computation (averages and total)

^CSV writer is too slow. fix the dataframe error so that the data is loaded into memory just-in-time. 


otherwise average implementation seems relatively simply?
